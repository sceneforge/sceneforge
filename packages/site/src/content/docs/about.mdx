Scene Forge is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to
create, visualise and manipulate 3D objects in a 3D space. The application
includes some features, such as:

- Add 3D hotspots with custom text and links;
- Export the scene as a JSON file with the possibility of embedding it in
  other web pages;
- Export the scene to a series of images to create a 3D animation.

The application is offline capable, which means it does not depends on a
request to a backend service to enable any given feature/capability.
